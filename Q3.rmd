By comparing the accuracy and precision values from 3.1 and 3.2, we realized that the model actually got worse by using the top PCs to develop the regression model. Since PCA works by estimating a sequence of principle components that have maximal dependence on the response variable, it can have either a positive or negative effect on the performance of the classifier. Although using PCA for dimensionality reduction could be beneficial in reducing overfitting and simplifying the model. It can also lead to loss of information and sometimes result in worsened performance, especially when we only chose the top 5 PCs in our analysis. Some of the variance in the original train data could be important for classification and was lost during the process. Therefore, whether to use PCA or not should depend on the nature and characteristics of the data set, specifically the relationship between features and target variables (diagnosis in this case). It is clear that after running analysis on both methods, the PCA technique is not appropriate for refining the model performance for this data set.

Firstly, this ROC plot indicates that our model has the ideal separability of classes meaning that we have selected the optimal threshold (0.5) for the classification model. This is because the AUC is approximately 1 as seen from the plot, which indicates that the curves for the positive class (Malignant cell in our case) and negative class (Benign cell) don't overlap at all. This means that the model can perfectly distinguish between B and M cells.
